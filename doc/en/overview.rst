Introduction
============

This document is a manual for the Fermi surface drawing program
"FermiSurfer". FermiSurfer has been developed since 2012 by Mitsuaki
Kawamura (ISSP, The University of Tokyo); it is opened on web at
November, 2014. It draws Fermi surfaces, and plot :math:`k`\ -depend matrix
elements such as the superconducting gap and orbital character with
colors.
