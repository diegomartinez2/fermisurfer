FermiSurfer for Android
=======================

Functionally limited version of FermiSurfer can be used in Android.

Install
-------

Download APK file from the following page

https://osdn.net/projects/fermisurfer/releases/p16366

then install it.

Input file
----------

FermiSurfer for Android reads an input file whose name and path are fixed to
``/Download/frmsf``.
Therefor, we need to change the file name whenever we read each input file.
For example, if we download the following file,

http://fermisurfer.osdn.jp/Nb1_Im-3m_151406/Nb4D.frmsf

we need to change the file name from ``Nb4D.frmsf`` to ``frmsf`` before we run
FermiSurfer app.

Run
---

When FermiSurfer app runs, the above input file is read automatically,
and Fermi surfaces are displayed.
We can do the following operations:

* Rotate objects by swiping.
* Magnify/shrink objects by swiping up/down the edge of the display. Both right and left edges can be used.
